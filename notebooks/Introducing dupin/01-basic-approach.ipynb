    "# Six Step Detection\n",
    "**dupin** is based on a 6 step method for detecting events in point cloud data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generate: Generate basic features from the point cloud. Such features can be per-point, aggregate, or global.\n",
    "2. Map: Transform the generated data into different distributions such as neighbor point averaging.\n",
    "3. Reduce: Take the non-scalar features and create scalar features from them (e.g. maximum, minimum, spread, mean, ...).\n",
    "4. Aggregate: Perform the first three steps across the time dimension of the point cloud data.\n",
    "5. Transform: Transform the signal using signal processing into a new feature signal (essentially the map step applied in the time direction). This step can involve feature selection or dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "6. Detect: Given the final feature signal detect events if any in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first, fourth, and sixth steps are always necessary; however, most are useful in common use cases.\n",
    "This tutorial will go through all six step in the detection process."
